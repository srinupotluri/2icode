Given an array of strings, each made up of a combination of letters and digits, write the functionality to find and return the largest sum of digits within a string in Java

Considering a variety of different input arrays, state any assumptions or design choices you had to make.

Notes:
Each digit should be considered its own 1-digit number i.e. in the third string below 36 is evaluated as 3 and 6 separately.
The input arrays can vary in length; however, they will not be larger than 10 strings.
Strings can vary in length; however, they will not be larger than 12 characters.
